                    <h3>London</h3>
                    <p>My first destination was London, at the age of 20. I explored the city and tried many different foods, cultures and environments.</p>
                </div>    
                <div>
                    <h3>France</h3>
                    <p>From Paris to Tolouse and Bordeaux. I explored multiple cities for the first time, stayed in a crappy hotel and had friends the let me crash at their place.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>The Netherlands and Belgium</h3>
                    <p>It's a shame I didn't know how to ride a bicycle back then, I could have explored much more. 
                    This time, not only did I visit different cities, but I also visited different countries.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Overseas - Japan</h3>
                    <p>This is when I traveled outside of Europe for the first time.
                   After a brief stop in Rome, where I enjoyed some delicious food, I flew over to Japan. I had the biggest culture clash in there.

                    <h3>Moving to Japan</h3>
                    <p>In 2021, I finally moved to Japan, where I have been living ever since. 
                        Before moving here, me and my (now) wife decided to explore the rustic, and modern streets of Madrid, Barcelona and Toledo, in Spain.
